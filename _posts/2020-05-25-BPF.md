What is BPF?

BPF is a virtual machine inside the Linux Kernel which will execute programs based on certain events in the kernel.

Security?

BPF programs are verified by BPF verifier before handing over to Kernel to excute, certain operations such a loops are not allowed.

So what is required to write and run a BPF program?

Step 1: First, we need to install some build dependencies and all the tools needed for the examples:

> dnf install make glibc-devel.i686 elfutils-libelf-devel wget tar clang bcc strace kernel-devel-5.0.9-301.fc30 -y

Step 2: Get kernel source

> cd /tmp
> wget -c https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/linux-5.0.9.tar.gz -O - | tar -xz

Now that we have the kernel source, we can move it to the /kernel-src folder.

NOTE THAT: All the examples using kernel sources in this repo assume that the kernel sources are available there. In case you don't like it, make sure you do a search and replace!

Step 3: At this point we move the kernel sources and compile libbpf. Again please notice the 5.0.9 here and change accordingly.

> sudo mv linux-5.0.9 /kernel-src
> cd /kernel-src/tools/lib/bpf
> make && sudo make install prefix=/
